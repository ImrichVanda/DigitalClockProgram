# DigitalClockProgram

A Digital Clock program displays the current time in a user-friendly format. It uses HTML for the structure, CSS for styling the clock's appearance, and JavaScript to update the time every second. 
JavaScript retrieves the current hours, minutes, and seconds, formats them, and dynamically displays them on the webpage.
The clock updates in real-time, providing an accurate display of the current time.
